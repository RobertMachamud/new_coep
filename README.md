### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

  - First Time Visitor Goals

    1. As a first time visitor, I want to have a good overview of the content and I want to quickly understand the main purpose of the site.
        1. The langing page background image shows one of the DFSK cars drifting in a valley/desert and the headline says 'for sale' so the user can quickly understand that the site is about selling cars.
        2. By clicking at the button 'go to products' the page scrolls to the product section where the purpouse of the site becomes clear.
        3. A minimalistic and simple design should make the purpouse clear and easy understadeble.

    2. As a first time visitor, I want to be able to navigate easily through all the different sections/pages without any complications.
        1. The site has been designed to be fluid and easy accesseble one page design.
        2. The navigation bar is on the very top (fixed) and very simply held - on the left is the logo and on the right are the telophone number and the navigation links (desktop version). On the tablet/mobil version the nav. links are hidden and can be revealed by clicking on the "burger button". 
        3. This is a design users are already used to. It becomes more intuitive.
        4. There are 4 navigation sections (Home, About us, Products, Footer).
        5. Navigaiton is very simple - by clicking on the navigation links the page scrolls to the selected section.

    3. As a first time visitor, I want to be able to interact with the content.
        1. Buttons with an arrow are revealing hidden content (or initiating a small animation like 'slide in/out'). Except the 'scroll to the top' button.
        2. Product images are swipeble and by clicking them an extra image popup window appears.
        3. By clicking on a car icon products are being filtered (only the products with the selected category are displayed) by category (suv/truck/electro).

    4. As a first time visitor, I want to get all information about the cars that I need - like prices, images, technical data etc.
        1. On the landing page there are informations like price, power, vmax, weight, co2 emission, fuel consumption and type of fuel on every car.
        2. On the prouct page users can find all data the site has to offer. some information is hidden (expandeble boxes) users can simply click on the arrow buttons to reveal the technical data.
        3. On the landing page every car card has one image and on the product page all avalible images for this car are swipeble (/clickable by using the arrow buttons).

    5. As a first time visitor, I want to easily find a way to get in touch - telephone/email/address.
        1. The telephone number is right in the header. The user can call it by clicking on it.
        2. All relevant contact information is in the footer - the user can either scroll to the bottom or just uses the navigation link 'Kontakt/Info'.

    6. As a first time visitor, I want to easily filter the products/cars by category (suv/truck/electro).
        1. There are 3 icons - the user just has to click on one of them to filter all products by that category.

    4. As a returning visitor, I want to ask for a test drive or to make an appointment.

    5. As a returning visitor, I want to check if there are any updates (new cars, prices, offers, etc).
